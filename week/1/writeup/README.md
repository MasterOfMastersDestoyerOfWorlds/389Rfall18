### Part 2 (75 pts)

I think that If this situation arose, first I would tell my boss about the security flaws and allow my boss to assess the situation.  I would then ask my boss how much time they would need to fix the problem and whether or not they were going to release the controller to cars on the road or not. Regardless if the company fixed the issues that I found, I would post the potential problems to a public forum after the allotted time was up because the fixes implemented may have not resolved the issue and I would want other people to know about the potential security issues before buying the car. If the company decided to not postpone the release of the ECU, I would go to a consumer watchdog, so that they can make the information more widespread. I think that I would be responsible for any harm because of unresolved security flaws if I hadn?t done anything because I knew that the product was flawed and could potentially be used to harm people, but chose to tell no one. With a widespread product the potential for harm implies that someone will be hurt and so by doing nothing I am condoning the harm of unsuspecting consumers. I don?t think that I would be legally responsible, but I would definitely be morally and ethically responsible for any harm.
