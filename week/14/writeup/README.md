4. %27)%3Balert(%27
5. next = javascript:alert() click the next button when the page loads.
6. httpS://www.google.com/jsapi?callback=alert the callback link is just a site that has the javascript command in it which is called when you load the next site. You need to capitalize any letter in the http so that the regular expression cannot filter it out.
